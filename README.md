Problem Statement: <br />
House loan financing companies as a subset sector within the insurance industry, rigorously review each loan application to ensure that the applicant has the proven capability to pay off the loan within the desired timetable.  If this evaluation process is bypassed and not given the needed weight of importance, the company runs the risk of being ruined by defaulted loans.  This evaluation process results in processing and transaction downtime (in days) when the company agents have to individually receive, assess and evaluate eligibility of customers who are applying for house loans. This downtime directly equates to opportunity cost not only to the company, but also to the customer. 

Objective 1. Create a prediction model to automate the eligibility process<br />

This model should be proven to be of significant accuracy. Only then it will be able to help automate eligibility feedback to house loan applicants who submitted their application via the online form on their website.More weight of importance is given to false positives than false negatives.<br />

Objective 1.a Determine the best customer segment for house loan applicants
To satisfy Objective (1), the best customer fit must first be determined as this  will be beneficial to help boost the marketing efforts of the company. Knowing where and who to target may maximize marketing budgets.
